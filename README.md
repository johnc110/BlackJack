# BlackJack
Blackjack starts with players making bets.

Dealer deals 2 cards to the players and two to himself (1 card face up, the other face down).

Blackjack card values: All cards count their face value in blackjack. Picture cards count as 10 and the ace can count as either 1 or 11. Card suits have no meaning in blackjack. The total of any hand is the sum of the card values in the hand

Players must decide whether to stand, hit, surrender, double down, or split.

The dealer acts last and must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 through 21.

Players win when their hand totals higher than dealer’s hand, or they have 21 or less when the dealer busts (i.e., exceeds 21). The payoff is 1 to 1 (i.e., even money).

Players lose their bet when they bust, or when their hand totals less than the dealer’s hand.

If the player’s and dealer’s hands total the same (known as a tie or push), the player retains his bet.
